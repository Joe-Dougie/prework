# Question 1: 
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below. 
def hello_name(user_name):
    user_name == "douglas"
print(user_name)

# Question 2:
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing def first_odds():
numbers = list(range(1,101))
print(numbers)
odd_numbers = list(range(1,100,2))
print(odd_numbers)

# Question 3:
# Please write a python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.
def max_num_in_list(a_list):
    a_list = list(range (1,100))
print(numbers)
max(numbers)

# Question 4:
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).
def is_leap_year(a_year):
    current_year = 1992
    while current_year <= 2040:
        print(current_year)
        current_year += 4

# Question 5:
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in the list are coseccutive numbers. For example,[2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The returnshould be boolean Type.

def is_consecutive(a_list):
    current_number = 1
    while current_number <= 8:
        print(current_number)
        current_number += 1
